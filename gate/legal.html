  <h1>Legal Notice & Disclaimer</h1>

  <p><strong>LiteWorlds.quest</strong> is an open-source platform intended strictly as a <strong>development and API hosting service for blockchain-based applications</strong>. This website is a <strong>non-commercial demonstration project</strong> designed to showcase blockchain integrations, smart contracts, and data interaction protocols.</p>

  <h2>No Financial Services</h2>
  <p>LiteWorlds.quest does not provide financial products, investment advice, or cryptocurrency exchange services. Integrations with Litecoin, OmniLite, or other digital tools are <strong>for illustrative and experimental purposes only</strong>. No guarantees of value, availability, or redemption are provided.</p>

  <h2>Kotia, Litecoin & On-Chain Assets</h2>
  <p>LiteWorlds utilizes native on-chain assets such as <strong>Litecoin</strong> and <strong>Kotia</strong> as fundamental units of interaction. Kotia operates on its own independent blockchain with a protocol-defined supply model. <strong>No official maximum supply is documented at this time.</strong></p>

  <p>Tokens created using this infrastructure are <strong>on-chain inscriptions</strong>, which are indexed and retrieved using open indexers compatible with <strong>OmniLite</strong> or <strong>Ordinals</strong> on the Litecoin blockchain. A custom inscription method using <code>OP_RETURN</code> is planned for Kotia to support a native token protocol tailored to the ecosystem. These tokens represent structured metadata anchored on-chain and are not intended as monetary units.</p>

  <h2>Custodial Wallet (Experimental Mode)</h2>
  <p>The current wallet feature exists solely to <strong>enable temporary access to infrastructure services</strong>. It is <strong>not intended for long-term asset storage</strong> or as a secure value repository. A <strong>non-custodial version is in development</strong> to grant users full control of their keys and assets.</p>

  <h2>DEX Integration</h2>
  <p>Any interaction with decentralized exchanges (DEX) occurs <strong>through public smart contracts</strong>. LiteWorlds does <strong>not operate trading services</strong> but may offer sample interfaces and development examples. The “Trader Bot” exists <strong>purely for demonstration purposes</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
  <p>All services and experimental endpoints are provided "as is". <strong>No liability is assumed</strong> for damages or losses arising from the use of this infrastructure. Users agree to these terms by interacting with the service. All code and content are governed by the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT License</a>.</p>

  <h2>The Litecoin Rainbow Road</h2>
  <p>LiteWorlds is inspired by the pioneering spirit of open-source culture and the Litecoin community. The phrase “Welcome to the Litecoin Rainbow Road” reflects our commitment to freedom, experimentation, and educational innovation in the digital age.</p>
