            <h2>genesis.php</h2>
            <p>This PHP code handles incoming requests based on URL parameters and performs different actions depending on the presence of certain variables. It is designed to either display a webpage or return an API response, processing the input accordingly.</p>
        
            <h3>General Workflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The script first checks if the "method" variable is set in the URL. If it is not set, the code proceeds to display a webpage.</li>
                <li>If the "method" variable is not provided, the code checks for an "info" parameter. Based on the value of "info," it either loads the homepage or redirects to specific information pages, such as "LWQW," "TWOS," or "docs."</li>
                <li>If neither "method" nor "info" are present, the script will display a default page, which is handled by including the "genesis.html" file. If an unknown "info" value is provided, the script returns a "Page not found" message.</li>
                <li>If the "method" variable is set, the code is designed to work as an API, returning data in JSON format, and enabling API functionalities.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Security and Error Handling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The script enforces a strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) by setting a header that only allows resources (scripts, styles) to load from the same origin, enhancing security by preventing malicious content from external sources.</li>
                <li>Error reporting is configured in the script with the line <code>ini_set("display_errors", 1);</code>, which ensures that errors are displayed during development. The error reporting level is set to only show fatal errors (<code>E_ERROR</code>), although this can be changed to show all errors for debugging purposes (<code>E_ALL</code>).</li>
                <li>In case of an error during API interaction or any other failure, a custom error handler function <code>Fail($RETURN, $error)</code> is used to return a structured JSON response indicating failure, providing a specific error message.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Key Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Response($RETURN, $response)</strong>: This function adds a new response message to the <code>$RETURN</code> object. The response is appended to the existing <code>response</code> array, allowing multiple status messages to be included in the final JSON response.</li>
                <li><strong>Fail($RETURN, $error)</strong>: This function is called when an error occurs. It takes an error message and an object <code>$RETURN</code> containing the current status, then encodes it into a JSON response and terminates the script.</li>
                <li><strong>Done($RETURN)</strong>: When an operation completes successfully, this function is used. It modifies the <code>$RETURN</code> object, marks the process as successful, and returns the data in a structured JSON format without an error message.</li>
                <li><strong>Node($RETURN, $method, $params)</strong>: This function is the core of the API's interaction with a remote Litecoin node. It constructs a JSON-RPC request with the specified method (such as "getblock") and parameters, then sends the request via HTTP POST to the specified <code>$rpc_url</code>. If the request is successful, it returns the result in a formatted JSON response. This function also handles basic authentication using <code>base64_encode()</code> to encode the username and password.</li>
                <li><strong>Node_LOCAL($RETURN, $method, $params)</strong>: Similar to <code>Node($RETURN, $method, $params)</code>, this function is specifically designed for communication with a local Litecoin node. It allows for the same JSON-RPC communication but uses a different default URL, aimed at interacting with the node running locally at <code>127.0.0.1</code> on port 9332.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Request and Response Flow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>$RETURN</code> object is initialized at the beginning of the script. It contains an array <code>response</code> to store response messages, an <code>error</code> field for storing error messages, and a <code>bool</code> field that indicates success or failure.</li>
                <li>Based on the provided URL parameters, the script will either generate a response page (if "method" is not set) or proceed to handle API-related operations (if "method" is provided).</li>
                <li>When handling API requests, the script executes the appropriate functions to interact with the Litecoin node. Depending on the outcome, it either returns the requested data or an error message.</li>
                <li>Additional functions and classes, like <code>require_once("../api/user.php")</code> and <code>require_once("../api/openode.php")</code>, are included to load external dependencies and define the necessary classes for handling users and open node operations.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Additional Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The script includes essential headers to configure content type as JSON (<code>Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8</code>) and allows cross-origin requests by setting the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to <code>*</code>, allowing the API to be accessed from any origin.</li>
                <li>Authentication for node interactions is handled using basic HTTP authentication, where the username and password are base64-encoded and sent in the request headers.</li>
                <li>External PHP files for additional functionality and endpoints are loaded at the end of the script, ensuring that the core functions are available for use in the API.</li>
            </ul>

        <section  id="register">
            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>This PHP code is responsible for handling user registrations via two-factor authentication (2FA), either by email or Telegram. The process includes security checks, input validation, and storing user data in the database. Once the user confirms the registration through 2FA, the account is activated. Let's break down the registration flow and focus particularly on the detailed security checks and their order.</p>
        
            <h3>General Workflow Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The script first checks the input parameters provided via the URL (GET request), including "user", "pass", and either "email" or "telegram". If any of these parameters are missing, the process halts, and an error message is returned.</li>
                <li>Next, the script validates the inputs. The username is checked for allowed characters, the password is verified to ensure it's encrypted with SHA512, and the 2FA method is validated. If everything passes, the script proceeds to store the registration details in the database.</li>
                <li>Finally, based on the selected 2FA method (Telegram or email), the user receives a verification message with a unique link. Once the user clicks the link to confirm, their registration details are moved to the active user table, completing the registration process.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Security Check 1: Initial Validation and Input Checks</h3>
            <p>The first part of the security check focuses on validating the incoming request parameters. The order of validation is important here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parameter Existence:</strong> The script first checks whether the "user" (username), "pass" (password), and at least one of the "email" or "telegram" parameters are provided. If any required parameter is missing, the script immediately halts and returns an error using the <code>Fail($RETURN, $error)</code> function. This ensures that the necessary data for registration is present before proceeding.</li>
                <li><strong>2FA Method Consistency:</strong> The script ensures that only one 2FA method is provided. It checks that both "email" and "telegram" are not supplied at the same time. If both are given, it returns an error, since the system only supports one 2FA method at a time (though more can be added later).</li>
                <li><strong>Email Format Validation:</strong> If the "email" parameter is provided, the script uses PHP's <code>filter_var()</code> function to ensure that the email is in a valid format. If the email does not meet the expected format, the script returns an error message indicating that the email is in an "absurd" format.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Security Check 2: User and Registration Validations</h3>
            <p>Once the parameters have been checked, the script proceeds to further validation steps for username, password, and 2FA. This section is crucial for ensuring that the registration process adheres to specific rules and avoids misuse:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Check (Prevent Account Spam):</strong> The script checks the IP address of the user making the request. To prevent account spam from a single IP address, it queries the database to check if more than 5 accounts have been created from the same IP address. If the limit is exceeded, the script halts and returns an error, stopping further registration attempts from that IP address. This is implemented with the following SQL query:
                    <pre>
                        SELECT * FROM user WHERE createip=:ip LIMIT 5
                    </pre>
                    If the number of rows returned is 5 or more, the registration is blocked.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Validation:</strong> The password provided by the user is validated to ensure it adheres to the required SHA512 encryption standard. Specifically, the password must be 128 characters long and consist only of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers). This step is crucial for ensuring that passwords are properly encrypted. The check is done using a regular expression that strips any non-alphanumeric characters from the password, and then compares the lengths to ensure it's correctly formatted for SHA512 hashing:</li>
                    <pre>
                        if (strlen($pass) != 128) Fail($RETURN, "Password is not sha512 encrypted");
                    </pre>
                    If the password fails this check, the registration is halted.</li>
                <li><strong>Username Validation:</strong> The username is then validated for allowed characters. The script ensures that the username contains only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and no special characters. This helps avoid usernames that could cause issues in the system or introduce security vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection risks). The length of the username is also checked to ensure it falls within a valid range of 6 to 18 characters. If the username contains invalid characters or does not meet length requirements, the registration is stopped:</li>
                    <pre>
                        if (strlen($name) < 6 || strlen($name) > 18) Fail($RETURN, "Username length mismatch, 6-18 characters");
                    </pre>
                <li><strong>Username Availability Check:</strong> The script checks the availability of the username by querying the database. It ensures that the username is not already taken or reserved. If the username is already in use, the registration fails and the user is prompted to choose a different one. This is handled by a function like <code>checkUsername($name)</code>, which queries the database for matching usernames and prevents duplicate accounts:</li>
                    <pre>
                        if (self::checkUsername($name)) Fail($RETURN, "Username already taken or reserved");
                    </pre>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>2FA Validation (Telegram or Email)</h3>
            <p>After the username and password validations, the script checks the chosen 2FA method (Telegram or email) to ensure that the user's identity is verified properly before completing the registration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Telegram Validation:</strong> If the user has selected Telegram as their 2FA method, the script verifies the provided Telegram handle by calling the Telegram API to ensure it is valid. Additionally, it checks whether the Telegram handle is already linked to an existing account. If the handle is already in use or reserved, the registration process fails. The handle is also validated to ensure it is not already linked to another account.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Validation:</strong> If the user has chosen email as their 2FA method, the email is converted to lowercase for consistency and stored. The system checks if the email is already registered or reserved by querying the database. If the email is already in use, the registration fails, and the user is prompted to provide a different email address.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Registration Process (Final Steps)</h3>
            <p>Once all security checks pass, the script proceeds to prepare the registration in the database and send the 2FA verification message:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storing the Registration in the Database:</strong> The user's registration data (username, password, 2FA details, and additional information like IP address) is inserted into a "prepare" table in the database, which holds temporary registration details until the user confirms via 2FA.</li>
                <li><strong>Sending 2FA Verification Message:</strong> Depending on whether the user selected Telegram or email for 2FA, the script sends a unique link to the user for confirmation. This link includes unique tokens (copper, jade, and crystal) and is used to confirm the user's identity.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Final Confirmation and Execution</h3>
            <p>After the user clicks the confirmation link (either from Telegram or email), the script executes the final steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The registration data is moved from the "prepare" table to the "user" table in the database, making the account active. The system also logs the creation time and last login time for future reference.</li>
                <li>The registration process is completed, and the user is informed that their account has been successfully created and activated.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Error Handling and Responses</h3>
            <p>The script is designed to gracefully handle errors throughout the process. If any validation or database operation fails, the script calls the <code>Fail($RETURN, $error)</code> function to return an error message to the user and halt the process. Otherwise, the script uses the <code>Response($RETURN, $message)</code> function to provide feedback on successful operations, ensuring that users are always informed of the status of their registration.</p>
        
            <h3>Summary of Key Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Input parameters validation (user, pass, 2FA method)</li>
                <li>Security check for IP address, password format, and username availability</li>
                <li>2FA validation (Telegram or email)</li>
                <li>Store registration in the "prepare" table</li>
                <li>Send verification link via Telegram or email</li>
                <li>Activate the account after confirmation and store the user in the "user" table</li>
                <li>Provide feedback to the user on successful or failed registration</li>
            </ol>
