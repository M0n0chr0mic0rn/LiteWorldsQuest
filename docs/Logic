API Logic

1. genesis.php
- decide between Website, Infopage or API
- error handling, security settings
- Global Functions for a little bit comfort - Response/Fail/Done/DoneLTC/Node
- RETURN Object - acts like an Kirby and gathers all information on the way excluded security data
- AUTHKEY double check
- Finally include classes, create objects of them and include the endpoints to use them

2. endpoints.php
- the full list of endpoints with security steps for the parameters/inputs
- check all needed parameters a given
- write their value into the RETRUN object with filter functions to prevent wrong or script input
- Depending on depth, call USER data and prepare requested action

3. Final Usage
- with a call to the LiteWorlds API you request data which is either puplic or private/attached to a USER
- public data is shown instantly
- private data is shown with the valid AUTHKEY
- for movements of private data a signature is required via on of our given 2fa methods
    -> 3 seperated keys gets created and used unique to encrypt your action, also there is a time window of 3 minutes
